# LXC Ruby Wrapper

Ruby wrapper to [LXC](http://lxc.sourceforge.net/) cli tools. 

Provides a simple ruby dsl and json API to manage containers. 

## Build status

This library uses Travis-CI service for automated tests.

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/stephenrjohnson/lxc-ruby.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/#!/stephenrjohnson/lxc-ruby)

## Requirements

Supported LXC versions:

- 0.7.5
- 0.8.0-rc1
- 0.8.0-rc2 - in works  

For testing purposes you can use [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com/) or [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/). Most of functionality
was tested on Ubuntu 11.04 / 11.10. Additional boxes could be found [here](http://www.vagrantbox.es/)

## Installation

As for now this gem is not released yet, so use gem install task:

```
rake build
rake install
```

## Usage

You should have LXC already installed on your system before using the library.

Example:

```ruby
require 'lxc'

# Check if all lxc binaries are installed
LXC.installed?

# Get LXC version
LXC.version

# Get current LXC configuration
LXC.config

# Get a list of all containers
LXC.containers

# Get a single container by name
LXC.container('name')
```

Container instance is a simple abstaction for lxc's container tools:

```ruby
c = LXC.container('foo')

# Get current status of container
c.status # => {:state => 'RUNNING', :pid => 1234}

# Check if container exists?
# this is needed since lxc does not raise any errors if container is
# not present in the system, and returns the same result as if container
# is actually stopped
c.exists? # => true

# Status helpers
c.running? # => true
c.frozen?  # => false

# Start and stop containers
c.start  # => {:state => 'RUNNING', :pid => 1234}
c.stop   # => {:state => 'STOPPED', :pid => -1}

# Free and unfreeze (also returns current status)
c.freeze
c.unfreeze

# Get container memory usage (in bytes)
c.memory_usage
c.memory_limit

# Get running processes
c.processes 
# => 
#[{"pid"=>"27404",
#   "user"=>"root",
#   "cpu"=>"0.0",
#   "memory"=>"0.1",
#   "command"=>"/sbin/init",
#   "args"=>""}]

# Destroy container
c.destroy # => true
```

To create a new container:

``` ruby
c = LXC::Container.new('foo')
c.create(path_to_lxc_config)
```

This method invokes ```lxc-create -n NAME -f CONFIG``` command. It *DOES NOT* create 
any rootfs images or configures anything.

### Running with sudo

By default LXC does not allow to run its command under unprivileged user. There are
two ways to make it work: 

**Using sudo**

```ruby
LXC.use_sudo = true
```

**Using lxc-setcap**

If you want to make container usable by non-root users, run lxc-setcap as root, and some capabilities will be set so that normal users will be able to use the container utils. This is not done by default, though, and you have to explicitly allow it.
